===============

Playing around with Processing and TheMidiBus for New Media Team Project. Works on Mac OSX with GarageBand (and presumably Ableton Live).

Setup
-----

1) Enable a virtual MIDI bus as per [this article](https://www.ableton.com/en/articles/using-virtual-MIDI-buses-live/).    
2) Open GarageBand (or whatever application) and set up a track with the virtual MIDI bus as the input.    
3) Open Processing and run the sketch.

Plays a note every second, nothing fancy. MIDI Output channel is hardcoded to "Virtual MIDI Bus", the name of my virtual MIDI bus.
